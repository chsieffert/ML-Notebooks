# ML-Notebooks

Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning experiments, a collection of Python notebooks showcasing the work I've conducted in my exploration of machine learning techniques and applications.

## Contents

This repository includes a variety of experiments, primarily focused on the following areas:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - During both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I developed multiple CNN architectures, some of which are included here.
   - These notebooks explore applications in image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK**
   - I've worked extensively with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for NLP and language generation experiments.
   - These experiments focus on text processing, tokenization, sentiment analysis, and language model development.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - I've experimented with retrieval-augmented generation, leveraging the OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 models to create intelligent agents.
   - These agents were developed to generate custom content in a proprietary application, demonstrating the power of RAG in constrained environments.

## Note on Datasets

For simplicity, the notebooks in this repository do not include the underlying datasets or additional context used in these experiments. If you wish to reproduce the experiments, please refer to the specific dataset sources mentioned within each notebook.
