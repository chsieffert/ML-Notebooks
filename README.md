# ML-Notebooks

Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning experiments, showcasing a variety of approaches I've explored throughout my studies.

## Contents

This repository includes the following key experiments:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Developed CNN architectures for image classification tasks, particularly using the MNIST dataset.

2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - Conducted experiments with GANs to explore data generation and augmentation, also applied to the MNIST dataset.

3. **MNIST Training and Testing Notebooks**
   - These notebooks explore different techniques for understanding the MNIST dataset:
     - **Feature Reduction**
     - **Feature Extraction**
     - **Manifold Learning**
   - Methods such as PCA, t-SNE, and LDA are used to analyze and reduce the dataset's dimensionality while maintaining key insights.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK**
   - Worked with the NLTK library for text processing, sentiment analysis, and language model generation.

5. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Experimented with OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to create agents capable of generating custom content in proprietary applications.

## Note on Datasets

The experiments primarily rely on the MNIST dataset, and while the datasets are not included here, you can reference the specific sources in the notebooks.
