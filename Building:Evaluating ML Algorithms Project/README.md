# Supermarket Sales Data Exploration

This project explores the **Supermarket Sales** dataset through various machine learning techniques, aiming to uncover insights and predict sales trends.

## Dataset - Supermarket Sales

The dataset, **supermarket_sales.csv**, has been provided in this repository. It contains transaction records from a supermarket, and has been used for both training and testing machine learning models.

## Notebooks Overview

- **Training Notebook (`training.ipynb`)**: This notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Multiple machine learning models have been applied to the supermarket sales dataset.
  
- **Test Notebook (`test.ipynb`)**: This notebook evaluates the performance of the trained models and answers key questions posed in the project description. It provides the final analysis based on model performance.

Both notebooks can be run without any modifications. All necessary dependencies are included, and the models have been pre-trained and are available in this repository. The notebooks can be executed in a Jupyter or Colab environment.

## Report for Analysis

A detailed IEEE-format report accompanies this project and includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing techniques.
- Model selection and training processes.
- Performance evaluation and comparisons of different models.
- Conclusions based on the supermarket sales dataset analysis.
